# freeCodeCamp-Quote-Generator
This project takes the existing [freeCodeCamp Quote Generator Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) and upgrades it through the use of [Deepgramâ€™s Node SDK](https://developers.deepgram.com/sdks-tools/sdks/node-sdk/) to fetch a quote.

## Getting started
- Clone this repo
- Add a `.env` file.
- In that `.env` file, include your Deepgram API Key (`DG_KEY='your-api-key'`) - [get it here](https://console.deepgram.com/signup) if you don't have one
- Run `npm i` in your terminal
- Run `node server.js` in your terminal

For the full directions, check out the Upgrade your freeCodeCamp Project blog post.
